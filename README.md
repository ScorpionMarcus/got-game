# got-game
GoT randomizer to win a FREE LUNCH

Every dawg gets assigned a character from Game of Thrones season 8. 
The first dawg whose character dies gets a free lunch from the other dawgs.
The winner then gets assigned a new character and the game starts over.

#TODO
1. Add player class
2. Assign a new character to a specific dawg after they win, without generating new characters for all dawgs
3. Pull characters and dawgs from csv files
4. Remove dead character from characters
